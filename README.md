#Project Tracker (In Development)
This lightweight web app (written in Django) allows you to set any goal that requires a count, and challenge yourself to meet that goal through charts, daily total, and eventually achievements.

##Feature List
- User can create any number of projects and set a goal for each project
  - Goal is set in the form of a start date, end date, and total count (lines of code, words, scrabble wins, etc)
- User can update his/her running total to see how close he/she is to reaching the final goal.
- User can earn achievements for meeting targets
- User can track his/her progress with the following metrics

### Tracking Metrics
Completed metrics are struck through.
- Average count per day
- Today's count
- ~~Target count~~
- ~~Target Average per day~~
- ~~Total count~~
- Count remaining to achieve goal
- ~~Days remaining~~
- Day goal achieved on
